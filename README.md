### Backend & Middleware Engineer

I build and maintain on-premise enterprise solutions based on Java. My work focuses on middleware, WAS operations, performance optimization, system integration, and automation across Nginx, Apache, and Tomcat environments. I also lead R&D efforts to introduce practical AI-driven features into the product.
